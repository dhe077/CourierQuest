The bear falls onto you but you feel nothing. You look up to see the bear above you in the air. You are lifting the bear above your head. The goblins look at you in shock...and fear. The goblins scatter in every direction.

You failed to hit the ogre with the dagger. The ogre hasn't noticed your poor attempt at a throw and it still advances towards you.

As ogre stomps in your direction and you wait for your end you hear the ogre yelp in pain as it raises it's foot up and you see the dagger wedged into it's sole. The ogre spins around and you see Garbanzo hanging on the back of the ogre. The ogre spins around once more and it falls forward towards you. THUNK! Garbanzo stands on the ogre's back with a dagger lodged in its spine.

We want to grant you your freedom and your own kingdom. We hope that you will see this offering as a sign of a truce between the humans and goblins.

You tear off the cloth wrapping that covers the package. You hold in your hands a glorious crown. The crown is adorned with precious materials and gemstones that seem foreign and otherworldy. The package also contains a note which says that this crown is an offering for the goblin leader in Eldoria.

"To the Goblin Queen, we hope that this reaches you safely by our esteemed courier. We, the Aurelians, bring this crown to you to acknowledge your presence in the lands. We want to grant you your freedom and your own kingdom. We hope that you will see this offering as a sign of a truce between the humans and goblins. Let this be a symbol of our peaceful future together."

You toss the package into the fiery depths and watch it plop into the lava and sink below.

A bubble of molten rock bursts out from where it landed.

A sudden gust of air rushes past you. You shield your eyes from any oncoming debris. Once the air subsides you look out and see a dragon floating above the lava in front of you.

It looks directly at you. A voice is heard in your head.

Dragon: Thank you for your payment! What do you wish for?
