# CourierQuest
This is project was created for the research purposes of a MSc in Computer Science at the University of Auckland. Courier Quest is a fantasy adventure narrative exercise video game (exergame) that was created to investigate the effects that branching and linear narratives have when it comes to player performance.

## Game Overview
Courier Quest was run on a laptop which was connected to a Meta Quest 2 and a digital exercise bike. Players are required to pedal on the bike while wearing the VR headset. The game uses the RPM from the exercise bike to move the player in the virtual space. The game has a branching narrative as it's core feature which allows players to make choices while they play the game. Players can use their hands to choose options in the game because the game utilises the Meta Quest 2's hand tracking feature.

## Technology Used
The exergame was made using the Unity Engine and the scripts were written in C#. I used YarnSpinner to create the branching narrative that's in the game. The XR Interaction Toolkit was used to create the hand tracking gameplay.
